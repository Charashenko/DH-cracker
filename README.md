# DH key cracker

## Assignment

The goal of this project is a program which will capture public parameters of Diffie-Hellmann protocol that are used to generate a key. Then it should calculate used prime numbers from captured parameters and derive original key. Then measure time required for cracker to find the key.  

## Restrictions

Libraries that calculate discrete logarithm are prohibited.
